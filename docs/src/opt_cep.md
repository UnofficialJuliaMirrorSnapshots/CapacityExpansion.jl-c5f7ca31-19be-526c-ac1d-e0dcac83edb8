# Optimization Problem Formulation

## General
The capacity expansion problem (CEP) is designed as a linear optimization model. It is implemented in the algebraic modeling language [JUMP](http://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/latest/). The implementation within JuMP allows to optimize multiple models in parallel and handle the steps from data input to result analysis and diagram export in one open source programming language. The coding of the model enables scalability based on the provided data input, single command based configuration of the setup model, result and configuration collection for further analysis and the opportunity to run design and operation in different optimizations.

The basic idea for the energy system is to have a spacial resolution of the energy system in discrete nodes. Each node has demand, non-dispatchable generation, dispatachable generation and storage capacities of varying technologies connected to itself. The different energy system nodes are interconnected with each other by transmission lines.
The model is designed to minimize social costs by minimizing the following objective function:

```math
min \sum_{account,tech}COST_{account,'EUR/USD',tech} + \sum LL \cdot  cost_{LL} + LE \cdot  cos_{LE}
```

## Variables and Sets
The models scalability is relying on the usage of sets. The elements of the sets are extracted from the input data and scale the different variables. An overview of the sets is provided in the table. Depending on the models configuration the necessary sets are initialized.

## Running the Capacity Expansion Problem

!!! note
    The CEP model can be run with many configurations. The configurations themselves don't mess with each other though the provided input data must fulfill the ability to have e.g. lines in order for transmission to work.

An overview is provided in the following table:

| description                                                                          |  unit            | configuration           | values                                      | type           | default value |

They can be applied in the following way:
```@docs
run_opt
```

## Solver
The package provides no `optimizer` and a solver has to be added separately. For the linear optimization problem suggestions are:
- `Clp` as an open source solver
- `Gurobi` as a proprietary solver with free academic licenses
- `CPLEX` as an alternative proprietary solver

Install the corresponding julia-package for the solver and call its `optimizer` like e.g.:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Clp")
using Clp
optimizer=Clp.Optimizer
```

## Scaling
The package features the scaling of variables and equations. Scaling variables, which are used in the numerical model, to `0.01 ≤ x ≤ 100` and scaling equations to `3⋅x = 1` instead of `3000⋅x = 1000` improves the shape of the optimization space and significantly reduces the computational time used to solve the numerical model.

The values are only scaled within the numerical model formulation, where we call the variable `VAR`, but the values are unscaled in the solution, which we call `real-VAR`. The following logic is used to scale the variables:
`real-VAR [EUR, USD, MW, or MWh] = scale[:VAR] ⋅ VAR`
`  0.01 ≤ VAR  ≤ 100`
`⇔ 0.01 ≤ real-VAR / scale[:VAR] ≤ 100`

The equations are scaled with the scaling parameter of the first variable, which is `scale[:COST]` in the following example:
`  scale[:COST]⋅COST = 10⋅scale[:CAP]⋅CAP`
`⇔              COST = 10⋅(scale[:CAP]/scale[:COST])⋅CAP`

### Change scaling parameters
Changing the scaling parameters is useful if the data you use represents a much smaller or bigger energy system than the ones representing Germany and California provided in this package Determine the right scaling parameters by checking the real-values of COST, CAP, GEN... (real-VAR) in a solution using your data. Select the scaling parameters to match the following:
`0.01 ≤ real-VAR / scale[:VAR] ≤ 100`
Create a dictionary with the new scaling parameters for EACH variable and include it as the optional `scale` input to overwrite the default scale in `run_opt`:
```julia
scale=Dict{Symbol,Int}(:COST => 1e9, :CAP => 1e3, :GEN => 1e3, :SLACK => 1e3, :INTRASTOR => 1e3, :INTERSTOR => 1e6, :FLOW => 1e3, :TRANS =>1e3, :LL => 1e6, :LE => 1e9)
scale_result = run_opt(ts_clust_data,cep_data,optimizer;scale=scale)
```

### Adding another variable
- Extend the default `scale`-dictionary in the `src/optim_problems/run_opt`-file to include the new variable as well.
- Include the new variable in the problem formulation in the `src/optim_problems/opt_cep`-file. Reformulate the equations by dividing them by the scaling parameter of the first variable, which is `scale[:COST]` in the following example:
`  scale[:COST]⋅COST = 10⋅scale[:CAP]⋅CAP                  + 100`
`⇔              COST = 10⋅(scale[:CAP]/scale[:COST])⋅CAP   + 100/scale[:COST]`

## Opt Result - A closer look

!!! note
    The model tracks how it is setup and which equations are used. This can help you to understand the models exact configuration without looking up the source code.

The information of the model setup can be checked out the following way:
```@setup 3
using CapacityExpansion
using Clp
optimizer=Clp.Optimizer
state="GER_1"
years=[2016]
ts_input_data = load_timeseries_data_provided(state;T=24, years=years)
cep_data = load_cep_data_provided(state)
ts_clust_data = run_clust(ts_input_data;method="kmeans",representation="centroid",n_init=10,n_clust=5).best_results
```
```@example 3
result = run_opt(ts_clust_data,cep_data,optimizer;descriptor="Model Name")
println.(result.opt_info["model"])
```
