[CapacityExpansion](https://github.com/YoungFaithful/CapacityExpansion.jl) is a [julia](https://www.juliaopt.com) implementation of a input-data-scaling, multi-sector capacity expansion modeling framework.

The main purpose of the package is providing an extensible, simple-to-use generation and transmission capacity extension model that allows to address a diverse set of research questions in the area of energy systems planning. The secondary purposes are:
1) Providing a simple process to integrate (clustered) time-series input data, geographical input data, cost input data, and technology input data.
2) Providing a model configuration, a modular model setup and model optimization.
3) Providing an interface between the optimization result and further analysis.

The package uses [TimeSeriesClustering](https://github.com/holgerteichgraeber/TimeSeriesClustering.jl) as a basis for its time-series aggregation.

This package is developed by Elias Kuepper [@YoungFaithful](https://github.com/youngfaithful) and Holger Teichgraeber [@holgerteichgraeber](https://github.com/holgerteichgraeber).

## Installation
This package runs under julia v1.0 and higher.
It depends on:
- `JuMP.jl` - for the modeling environment
- `CSV.jl` - for handling of `.csv`-Files
- `DataFrames.jl` - for handling of tables
- `StatsBase.jl` - for handling of basic  
- `JLD2.jl` - for saving your result data
- `FileIO.jl` - for file accessing
- `TimeSeriesClustering.jl` - for time-series data

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("CapacityExpansion")
```

A solver is required to run an optimization as explained in section [Solver](@ref).
Install e.g.:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Clp")
```
